# dockerize a simple spring boot project

- we use maven as a build bool for this
- mvn important commands

mvn validae
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package

when we run `mvn package` it will run all the 3 previous commands as well

- you can create a simple dockerfile 
- this will take a lot of time to build
